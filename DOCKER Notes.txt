Hello Docker!!

Before docker problems : 
Virtual Machine problem - Operating System required and Bootup is high
Dependancy management
Project Migration

>> Pre-Docker, we had to install different different operating system to run multiple application
>> We can run multiple applications on single operating system using docker containers.

Docker is an application for building, running and shipping application in a consistant manner so if appication runs fine on one machine than it can work fine on other machines too.

docker-compose up

Isolating different applications from one another for their environment to let them work fine is another feature of docker.

deleting one application with its environment is  just  one command away :

docker-compose down --rmi all

*virtual machines vs containers*

>> Dockerfiles are used to create
